    ðŸš€ Dynamic SignalStore CRUD: Built for Flexibility

    Ever needed a CRUD system that adapts to different use cases? 
    Weâ€™ll show you how to build a SignalStore feature that allows 
    users to dynamically toggle features and adjust types accordingly.

    Expect:
    âœ” Live coding & hands-on problem-solving
    âœ” Strong typing vs. flexibility in TypeScript
    âœ” Designing a SignalStore extension that adapts to user configurations

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.0.

## Development server

You can run the repo in Stackblitz automatically if you want with the button at the top. But if you want to run it locally: 

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Yes, there are tests! At least for the basic store, at the time of this copy I need to make tests for the mapping version.

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
